# 6ABOS: 6S-based Atmospheric Background Offset Subtraction

**6ABOS** is a novel, efficient, and generic atmospheric correction (AC) framework designed specifically for **aquatic remote sensing**. It leverages a radiative transfer modeling (RTM) approach based on the **6S (Second Simulation of the Satellite Signal in the Solar Spectrum)** model to retrieve accurate water surface reflectance from hyperspectral sensors.

## 🌊 The Challenge
In aquatic remote sensing, accurately retrieving water quality parameters (e.g., chlorophyll-a, turbidity, CDOM) is a significant challenge. Light interaction with both the atmosphere and the water column is complex, and for inland water bodies, the water-leaving signal is often extremely weak compared to the atmospheric contribution. Standard land-based AC methods frequently fail to capture the subtle spectral signatures required for aquatic analysis.

## 🎯 Objectives
The objective of 6ABOS is to bridge the gap between complex RTMs and practical application by providing a method that is:
* **Efficient:** Reducing the computational burden of traditional pixel-by-pixel inversions.
* **Generic:** Applicable to various hyperspectral platforms, specifically validated for **Level 1 PRISMA and EnMAP** imagery.
* **Simple:** Utilizing a streamlined RTM scheme that remains accessible while maintaining scientific rigor.

## 🚀 Key Features
* **6S Engine Integration:** Built upon the robust and gold-standard 6S radiative transfer model version 1.1.
* **Multi-Sensor Support:** Optimized for the high spectral resolution of **PRISMA** and **EnMAP** missions.
* **Aquatic-Centric Design:** Specifically tuned for inland water bodies where atmospheric background noise is a dominant factor.
* **Background Mitigation:** Implements a specialized offset subtraction to isolate the water-leaving radiance from atmospheric interference.

## 🛠 Methodology
6ABOS implements a background offset subtraction framework. By modeling the atmospheric path radiance and solar irradiance through 6S, the system calculates a refined offset that is subtracted from the Top-of-Atmosphere (TOA) signal to retrieve the Bottom-of-Atmosphere (BOA) reflectance.
